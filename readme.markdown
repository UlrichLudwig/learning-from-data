Programming assignments for Cal Tech's [Machine Learning](http://work.caltech.edu/telecourse) class by Professor Yaser Abu-Mostafa. My notes for this class are available on [my site](http://blaenkdenum.com/notes/machine-learning-theory/).

The assignments are done in Python with [NumPy](http://www.numpy.org/) and other [SciPy](http://www.scipy.org/) packages.
